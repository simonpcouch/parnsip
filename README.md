![A screenshot of a GitHub code search on “parnsip”, which yields 82
results.](man/figures/parnsip_code_search.png)

## Installation

You can install parnsip from
[GitHub](https://github.com/simonpcouch/parnsip) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("simonpcouch/parnsip")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem
(that is, mistyping `"parsnip"`:

``` r
library(parnsip)
```

## Roadmap

-   It could be nice to re-export all of parsnip—or re-write it
    entirely—so that you could do the `::` thing with parnsip.
